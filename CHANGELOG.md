## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **The thread-local pending-construction stack now keeps a hard per-construction frame boundary (same-type nested-construction bleed).** Init-accessor stores merged into the top `PendingStorage` frame purely by `_State` *type*, with no notion of which construction the frame belonged to. A same-type model construction beginning while another's frame was still open — reachable when a default-value expression in a user-written init (transitively, e.g. via a conditional factory/registry) constructs another instance of the same model type — merged its prologue stores into the outer frame and its pop then *stole* that frame: cross-instance value bleed, the outer construction's `pendingID` adopted by the wrong instance, and the outer construction re-evaluating default expressions it had already evaluated (observable with impure defaults such as `UUID()`/counters, and as doubled side effects). Two local rules now bound every construction without any macro-emission change: index 0's `_threadLocalStoreFirst` always opens a fresh frame, and a keypath collision in a middle/last store (the top frame already holds that property) opens a fresh frame — complete for same-type nesting because a given model type always fires the same defaulted-property accessor sequence. Same thread-local family as 1.0.8's stale-`latest` fix. New `PendingConstructionBoundaryTests` cover the two failing default-expression shapes and pin the toolchain orderings the design rests on (accessors fire only from prologue default evaluation in declaration order — even for properties the body assigns; `_$modelSource`'s pop fires in the prologue before the body, so nested same-type construction in an init *body* and throwing-init residue are safe by ordering, and now also by the frame rules on any toolchain that orders differently).

Concurrency-audit fixes (full-codebase race/deadlock review + ThreadSanitizer/AddressSanitizer passes; the full parallel suite ran 25 TSan warnings before, expected ~0 library warnings after):

- **Unlocked `Reference.state` reads no longer race `Reference.clear()` / concurrent writers (TSan-confirmed, torn-read class).** `state` is protected by the hierarchy lock, but three read paths ran outside any locked scope: `_ModelSourceBox._modelState.getter` (reached by deep-access visitors walking a value copy *after* `subscript.read`'s lock scope ended), `makeFrozen`/`makeLastSeen`'s whole-struct copies, and `_performCollectionSet`'s post-transaction re-activation loop. A concurrent collection write clearing a removed child could tear those reads (CoW/ARC hazard on a full `_ModelState` struct). All three now read under the live hierarchy lock via `Reference.withHierarchyLockIfLive` (no live context ⇒ no locked concurrent writer left to race).

- **Observation-registrar lazy publication was double-checked locking without atomics (TSan-confirmed).** The `RegistrarPair` is now created eagerly with the `RegistrarBox` (immutable `let` chain ⇒ the hot background-registrar read is lock-free *and* race-free — previously it was lock-free and racy); only `_main` stays lazy and is now read/written strictly under the hierarchy lock. The `cancellations` lazy accessor's identical unlocked fast path was removed (always locks now), and `cancelAllRecursively` snapshots the store under the lock. Read-path benchmark ratios unchanged.

- **`AnyContext.onActivate()` no longer resurrects a destructed context.** The unconditional `defer { modeLifeTime = .active }` let `_performCollectionSet`'s outside-the-lock re-activation loop (running over a possibly-stale element list) flip a concurrently-destructed context back to `.active` — a zombie with `isDestructed == false` forever that no teardown path revisits. Activation is now a guarded `.anchored → .active` transition only. (Same concurrent-collection-writer family as 1.0.8's `pendingActivation` fix.)

- **The last-seen TTL `clear()` is now generation-guarded (defense-in-depth).** `Context.onRemoval` schedules `reference.clear()` ~2 s out (TTL path) or into the deferred teardown callbacks (non-TTL path) with no re-anchor guard, while `Context.deinit` deliberately uses `clearStateForGeneration`. A re-anchor in that window would have its live state wiped by the stale task — under the *old* hierarchy's lock, disjoint from the new one's (data race + logic bug). Currently unreachable through the public API (the TTL task pins the old context, so re-anchor attempts are rejected as "already anchored" until it fires) — the new `clear(ifGeneration:)` removes the reliance on that subtle coupling.

- **`onChange(of:cancelPrevious: true)` now actually serializes bodies (ports `forEach`'s "Behaviour B").** It used to spawn the new body *before* cancelling the previous one and never awaited the old body's unwind, so a cancelled body's tail could interleave with (or land after) the next body — last-writer-wins on stale state, contradicting the documented `task(id:)`-analogous semantics. Now: cancel previous → await its full unwind (including defers) → spawn next; the final body is awaited before the outer task ends. Regression test mirrors the existing `forEach` body-race test.

- **`onChange` no longer has a registration gap.** Its `Observed` was constructed inside the spawned task, so a write landing before the cooperative pool scheduled the body was silently missed (with `initial: false`, the transition was dropped entirely). Construction is hoisted to the call site — registration completes before `onChange` returns, matching `forEach(Observed(...))`/`task(id:)`/the pack overloads.

- **`forEach(abortIfOperationThrows: true)` can no longer lose the abort.** The inner catch ran `cancelAll(for: abortKey)` *before* setting `hasBeenAborted`; a body that threw before the caller keyed the outer cancellable, combined with preemption before the flag store, left the outer iteration running despite the abort. The flag is now set first, so every interleaving is covered by either the keyed cancel or the caller's flag check.

- **Cancelling an `Observed` stream now sticks on the AccessCollector path (zombie-observer leak).** Cancel was a bare `reset { }`; an in-flight `performUpdate` (queued on the background call queue or as a writer's post-lock callback) re-registered every `context.onModify` subscription *after* cancellation, and those closures strongly capture the collector — a cancelled observer that recomputes on every write and yields into a finished continuation for the life of the context. `AccessCollector` now has a sticky cancelled flag checked under the same lock by registration, reset, and `performUpdate`; `reset`'s set arithmetic is a single critical section (a concurrent cancel could previously corrupt the added/no-longer-active diff); the WOT gap-shadow's cancel got the same treatment. Regression test verifies a cancelled observer stops recomputing under a write storm (fails deterministically on the old code).

- **`Observed`/memoize initial emission can no longer arrive out of order (root cause of the known `UpdateStreamTests.testRace` per-1000 flake).** A write landing between dependency registration and the initial emission could emit `v1` (via `performUpdate`) *before* the initial `v0` — and the `last.value` dedup cache then suppressed re-convergence, pinning the consumer on the stale value forever. `updateInitial` now participates in the same `updateLock`/index ordering as `update(with:index:)`: if a newer value already won, the stale initial value is neither emitted nor cached.

- **`@ObservedModel`/`ViewAccess` races closed:** the `willAccess` double-registration window (two threads passing the `accesses[path]` nil-check across the deliberate unlock could leak an `onModify` registration that strongly captures the context — now a re-check under the re-taken lock cancels the loser's registration, which also removes a stale-observer re-insert after a root change); unlocked reads of `root` and `suppressObjectWillChange` moved under the lock; `model.context` resolution hoisted out of `updateObserved`'s `lock.withLock` (defense against re-entrant materialization under the non-recursive lock).

- **Undo-system thread-safety:** the per-property undo `baseline` box was read under the context lock but written from restore/post-lock closures with no lock at all — torn value/ARC race on arbitrary `T`; it is now a locked box (leaf-level critical sections, no ordering cycle). Concurrent `undo()`/`redo()` calls could interleave pop/captureReverse/apply and corrupt redo entries — whole operations now serialize on a dedicated recursive `operationLock` (never taken on the writer/`push` path, so no AB-BA with the hierarchy lock). `UndoAvailability` notifications snapshot both flags in one lock acquisition.

- **Smaller races:** `Context.onModify` / `AnyContext.onAnyModification` did their destructed check and callback insert in separate lock acquisitions — teardown in the gap left callbacks that never receive their `finished` signal and pin their captures (now check-and-insert atomically; a post-destruct `onAnyModification` registration receives its terminal `isFinished` call immediately). Production teardown now seals the task registry in the same locked scope that flips the lifetime, so a registration racing teardown is cancelled immediately instead of deferring to `Cancellations.deinit` (the test path already sealed). `AnyContext.parents`/`rootParent` snapshot `weakParents` under `parentsLock` (cross-hierarchy readers could catch a CoW reallocation mid-read). `node.debug()`'s diff emitter swaps its previous-value snapshot in one critical section (garbled-debug-output only).

- **Test-infrastructure races (no library behavior change):** `TestAccess._lastActivityNs` is now read under the lock by the executor-drive fixpoint loop (was the dominant TSan noise: 18 of 25 warnings); `_resolveUnmetPredicatesAtFixpoint` re-checks driver cancellation *inside* the `_pendingExpects` lock, closing the TOCTOU where a stale driver could fail the *next* `expect` as `.timeout`; the global-quiescence lookback comment was corrected — the 1000 s constant is load-bearing (it caps `sinceActivityNs`, so it must stay far above every grace window; the "1 s" the old comment described would close the fail-gate permanently); GTS timer deadlines use `UInt64` arithmetic (the old `Int(delayNs)` conversion trapped for delays > ~2.1 s on 32-bit-`Int` platforms); `TaskCancellable`'s `_hasStartedRunningBox` install is lock-ordered against concurrent readers and its safety comment stated the wrong polarity; `scheduleAfter`'s doc no longer overpromises that cancel prevents an in-flight callback (all in-tree consumers carry once-guards).

### Changed

- **Test-suite hardening only — no library change.** Two `.modelTesting` tests that flaked exclusively under `macOS (parallel)` CI saturation (and full-suite parallel `swift test` under load), while passing serially, on Linux, and in isolation, are now load-independent:
  - `ChildActivationTaskTests.childTasksCompleteBeforeTeardown` — the child `node.task`'s async work moved from an off-executor `ImmediateClock.sleep` to an on-executor `Task.yield` chain (the validated `DrainItem`/`settleIsLoadIndependentAcrossChildTasks` shape). The off-executor sleep was invisible to the executor-drive's inactivity watchdog, so under saturation the test's wall-clock drifted past the `.modelTesting` trait cap (~103 s on a constrained CI runner vs. the 90 s scaled cap). On-executor suspensions keep progress visible to the watchdog, so a slow-but-progressing run never trips the cap. The unkeyed-task-vs-`checkExhaustion` teardown race under test is unchanged (`expect`, not `settle`, preserves the tight teardown window).
  - `ClockTests` is now `.serialized` so its unbounded `ImmediateClock` timer producer (`testImmediateClock`) no longer runs concurrently with the registration-sensitive `testClockStepByStep` and starves it. No semantic change to either test.

- **CI hardening (Linux only) — no library change.** The `Linux (parallel)` job intermittently failed even though the build compiled and every test passed (`Test run with 764 tests … passed`, yet exit non-zero). Root cause is an upstream toolchain artifact: on Linux, swift-syntax's compiler-plugin message handler logs `Internal Error: DecodingError … Corrupted JSON … unexpected end of file` during macro expansion (a truncated/EOF frame on the compiler ↔ macro-plugin IPC pipe). It is emitted on essentially every Linux build — present in passing runs too (the serial job logs dozens and exits 0) — but occasionally surfaces as a non-zero `swift test` exit. macOS is unaffected (different plugin host; zero occurrences). Linux CI now runs through `scripts/ci-test`, which treats "build compiled + test run passed + zero real failures" as success and still fails hard on any genuine test/build failure (it does not retry or mask real failures). Nothing in the library or the `@Model` macro plugin changed.

## [1.0.8] — Cross-construction init-accessor state bleed fix; `pendingActivation` activation race fix

### Fixed

- **Constructing a `@Model` no longer overwrites a *prior* live instance's state via a stale thread-local.** A middle property's init-accessor (`_threadLocalStoreOrLatest`) used to write directly into `pendingStack.latest` whenever that was set, to support "phase-2" setter writes within a user-written init. But `latest` is a thread-local that PERSISTS across constructions and is cleared only by the index-0 property's `_threadLocalStoreFirst`. When the index-0 *tracked* property has no default and is assigned in the init body — which is exactly what happens when the declared-first stored property is a `let` (excluded from tracking), leaving the first tracked `var` to be set in the body — that clear never fires. A *fresh* construction's middle init-accessors then found a stale `latest` pointing at a PRIOR, still-live instance and wrote their birth values (e.g. an optional `@Model` child reset to `nil`) straight into it, with **no observable setter call** — silently resetting an existing live model's state the moment a sibling of the same type was constructed on the same thread. A middle init-accessor's value always belongs to the instance being constructed, so it now **always stacks**; the write-to-`latest` branch was unreachable for every model shape in the test suite. This is a deterministic positional bug, not a data race — see the fully-synchronous `ThreadLocalLatestBleedTests` (RED before, green after). It surfaced in the field as a live model's optional `@Model` child silently becoming `nil` when an identified-collection sibling was inserted during concurrent activity.

- **`Context.onActivate()` no longer data-races on `pendingActivation` under concurrent activation.** When two unsynchronized writers mutate the same identified-collection property concurrently (the field "two RMW writers" pattern), each `_performCollectionSet` runs its `structuralChange` re-activation loop (`element.activate()` → `onActivate()`) **outside** the `stateTransaction` lock. Two such loops calling `onActivate()` on the same child context then raced on the unsynchronized `pendingActivation` `var` — one writing `nil` while another read/called it — surfaced directly by ThreadSanitizer (`swift test --sanitize=thread`). The activation closure is now read-and-niled **under the hierarchy lock** and consumed only by the single caller that wins the atomic anchored→active transition in `super.onActivate()` (losers never touch it). Locking-discipline change only — single-threaded behaviour is unchanged (the value was always consumed exactly once by the first activation). Regression coverage in `ContainerReanchorResetTests` (run under TSan to exercise the race).

### Tests

- **`ReactiveWaitInfrastructureTests`'s cancel→resume bounds now scale with `SWIFT_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SCALE`.** The three "a cancelled wait resumes within N seconds" hang-detector assertions used raw nanosecond literals (`2_000_000_000` / `5_000_000_000`) that — unlike every other test-infra wall-clock budget — did **not** multiply by `ModelTestingTraitOptions.timeoutScale`. Under Linux-parallel CI saturation the cancel→resume measured 2.0–3.3 s, tipping the raw 2 s bounds over and failing `backgroundCallQueue_waitUntilIdle_cancellable` / `backgroundCallQueue_waitForCurrentItems_cancellable` — a load flake, not a real hang. The bounds now scale (CI runs `×3`), so a saturated runner has headroom while a genuine cancellation hang still exceeds the scaled budget. Test-only.

## [1.0.7] — `memoize` first-access lock-order deadlock fix

### Fixed

- **`memoize`'s first-access setup no longer deadlocks against a concurrent property write under `.modelTesting`.** A direct sibling of the 1.0.6 `reduceHierarchy` fix, on the path that fix did not cover. `memoize`'s first-access block took the context (hierarchy) lock — `context.lock { … }` — and only then, through the nested `Context.transaction`, the `TestAccess` write lock (`acquireWriteLock()`), i.e. **context → TestAccess**. That inverts the **TestAccess → context** order every writer uses (`Context._modify` / `Context.transaction` acquire `acquireWriteLock()` *before* `lock.lock()`), so a thread doing a first-access `memoize` (holding the context lock, awaiting the `TestAccess` lock) racing a writer (holding the `TestAccess` lock, awaiting the context lock) was a genuine AB-BA deadlock — observed as `settle()`/`expect()` hanging (never reaching a fixpoint) when one model activates and reads a memoized value while another writes a property, both on the concurrent drive. It was captured live with `sample` on a hung test host: a model activation whose `onActivate` read a memoized child value while drain-executor model tasks ran writes. `memoize` now acquires the `TestAccess` write lock **before** the context lock, matching the canonical order; both locks are recursive, so the nested `Context.transaction` re-enters harmlessly. Locking-discipline change only — no behavior change, and a no-op outside `.modelTesting` (`ModelAccess.acquireWriteLock()` is a no-op in production).

---

## [1.0.6] — Single-`@Model`-child same-`id` continuity; `reduceHierarchy` lock-order deadlock fix

### Fixed

- **A hierarchy traversal that registers parent-relationship observation no longer deadlocks against a concurrent property write under `.modelTesting`.** `AnyContext.reduce` — the core of `reduceHierarchy`/`mapHierarchy`, and the path every `@EnvironmentStorage` read walks to resolve a value up the ancestor chain — acquired the `TestAccess` lock (via `willAccessParents()` → `TestAccess.willAccess` → `registerReadOnlyPathWake`) **while already holding the context (hierarchy) lock**, because the registration ran inside `lock(observedParents)`. That inverts the `TestAccess.lock → context.lock` order every writer uses (`Context._modify` / `Context.transaction` call `acquireWriteLock()` *before* `lock.lock()`), so a writer holding the `TestAccess` lock and waiting on the context lock, racing a traversal holding the context lock and waiting on the `TestAccess` lock, was a genuine AB-BA deadlock — observed as `settle()`/`expect()` hanging (never reaching a fixpoint) when one model activates and reads an environment value while another writes a property, both on the concurrent drive. `willAccessParents()` is now hoisted out of the context lock, so the registration runs on the same `TestAccess → context` order as every writer; the parents list itself is still read under the lock. (The sibling storage/preference traversals already registered observation outside the lock.) Locking-discipline change only — no behavior change, and a no-op outside `.modelTesting`.

### Changed

- **Assigning a new instance to a single `@Model` child property is now consistent with collections and optionals: a same-`id` assignment continues the existing live child instead of replacing it.** Previously `model.child = NewChild(...)` always replaced (tore the old child down, anchored the new one) even when the new instance reused the existing child's Identifiable `id`, while `[Model]` and `Model?` properties treated a same-`id` assignment as *continuity* (the existing live child is kept, the new instance's state ignored). All child shapes now follow one rule: **`.id` is identity — to change a child you mutate it; assigning a fresh instance that reuses an existing `id` continues that child, and only a *different* `id` is a replacement.** This only affects `@Model` types that declare an explicit, reusable `id`; for a default-`id` model `.id == modelID`, so every distinct instance still replaces exactly as before. To intentionally swap in different state under the same domain key, either mutate the existing child or give the new instance a distinct `id`.

---

## [1.0.5] — Same-`id` child-replace anchoring fix; `Model.modelID` + `settle`/`expect` runaway-source diagnostic

### Fixed

- **Replacing an optional `@Model` child (or any non-collection `ModelContainer`-typed property) with a new instance that reuses the existing child's explicit Identifiable `id` no longer leaves the new child unanchored.** The `ModelContainer` write path had a fast path — `if containerIsSame(newValue, container) { container = newValue; return }` — that, when the structure looked unchanged by `.id`, stored the assigned value *raw* and skipped `updateContext`. That is correct only when the assigned value is the already-anchored live child; for a *fresh* instance sharing an existing domain `id` (the case a `@Model` with an explicit, reusable `id` makes reachable) it stored a pre-anchor value with **no context** — the child silently dropped out of the hierarchy: no observation, no tasks, no `onActivate`, and reads returned its detached state. A SwiftUI view bound to such a child rendered its birth state and never updated. The fast path is removed; the path now always reconciles, so a same-`id` assignment reuses the existing child's context (continuity, matching the `[Model]` collection write path) and the child stays live. Genuine no-op write-backs stay cheap via the per-element `findOrTrackChild` fast path. Only same-`id` replacement was affected — different-`id` replacement and `nil`→value already anchored correctly.

### Added

- **`public var Model.modelID: ModelID` — the model's stable, per-instance identity.** Distinct from `id`: `id` is the `Identifiable` conformance and may be a *domain* value when a model declares its own `id` (e.g. a key reused by different instances over time), whereas `modelID` identifies *this specific instance*, is stable for its lifetime (assigned at construction, before anchoring, and carried into the live context), and is never reused. It is the reliable way to tell whether two model values refer to the same live instance; for a model without an explicit `id`, `modelID` and `id` are identical.

- **DEBUG diagnostic for duplicate ids in a model collection.** Assigning a `[Model]` (or `IdentifiedArray`-style) collection in which two *distinct* instances share an Identifiable `id` now emits a `reportIssue` in DEBUG, mirroring SwiftUI's `ForEach` duplicate-id warning. Such elements are conflated onto a single child context (the duplicate resolves to the first's context and its state is lost), which previously failed silently. The check is keyed by `modelID`, so the *same* instance appearing more than once — legitimate model sharing — does not warn; only distinct instances colliding on one `id` are flagged.

- **`settle()`/`expect()` now name the runaway source when a model never reaches a fixpoint.** Under the executor-drain (1.0.4), a reactive cascade that never converges — a `node.forEach(Observed { … })` / `node.onChange` whose source emits a non-`isSame` value each evaluation, or that sits in a feedback loop (a write that re-triggers it) — makes `settle()` correctly time out with "model never reached a fixpoint." Previously the diagnostic listed *every* active registration, so the actual offender was hidden. Now the drive counts per-call-site reactive-body deliveries; on a timeout it prepends a callout naming the registration that fired far more than a one-shot **and was still firing at the timeout** ("⚠️ likely runaway: `Model: \"…\" @ File.swift:NN` fired 4,812× and was still firing…"), with the fix guidance (make the emitted value `isSame`/`Equatable`-stable, or break the cycle). Counting is gated through `ModelAccess` so it is a no-op (zero cost) outside `.modelTesting`. Diagnostic-only — no behavior change.

### Tests

- **`FrozenChildObservationTests`** — characterises the live-vs-frozen observation contract behind the "sub-view stuck at a child's birth state" symptom: a child read out of a live parent is itself live and tracks mutations, whereas a frozen copy (same `modelID`, no context) silently does not participate in `withObservationTracking` (the iOS 17+ registrar path SwiftUI drives invalidation through) — so a non-live value must never reach an `@ObservedModel`. Also covers reading per-instance identity via the public `modelID` when an explicit domain `id` shadows `Identifiable.id`.

---

## [1.0.4] — `node.memoize` produce-per-access fix + executor-drain test determinism

### Fixed

- **`node.memoize` no longer degrades to recompute-per-access once a dependency changes — the produce-per-access thrash that blocked adopters from upgrading past 1.0.2.** Two defects compounded into "every read runs `produce()`": (1) a value-changing dependency write left the cache entry permanently dirty, because the coalesced `performUpdate` *preserved* the dirty flag when storing a recomputed value (it couldn't tell "the mutation this recompute already incorporates" from "a concurrent mutation during produce") — so after one write, every subsequent access found the entry dirty and recomputed inline forever, even on a fully idle machine; (2) while the async revalidation task lagged (saturated cooperative pool), each dirty read recomputed inline *and threw the result away*, so N accesses in the starvation window cost N produces instead of 1. The fix replaces the `isDirty` boolean with monotonic `dirtyVersion`/`cleanVersion` counters: a recompute captures `dirtyVersion` before running `produce()` and advances `cleanVersion` to exactly that value when it commits — so the dependency changes the recompute incorporated are cleared, while a change arriving *during* `produce()` (which bumps `dirtyVersion` further) correctly keeps the entry dirty. A dirty read now also writes its fresh value back into the cache (silently on the `withObservationTracking` path — the already-scheduled `performUpdate` remains the sole notifier and dedups against the last *notified* value, so a read never fires observer notifications), so subsequent accesses in a starvation window hit the cache. Net effect: produce-count is now O(1) per dependency change regardless of access count or pool load, on both the `withObservationTracking` and `AccessCollector` paths, for single and chained memoizes. (Adopters pinned to `exact: "1.0.2"` solely to avoid this can move to the normal `from:` requirement once this ships.)

- **Reading a memoized property inside `withUntrackedModelReads { }` now returns through the same cached fast path as a tracked read** instead of being materially slower. With the produce-per-access thrash fixed (above), an untracked cached memoize access is now ~0.9× the cost of a tracked one (it skips the observation dispatch), rather than the ~6× *slower* adopters measured on 1.0.3 — that figure was the discarded-recompute cost, not a pure access-path cost.

### Changed

- **`.modelTesting`'s wait verbs (`settle`/`expect`/`waitUntil`) now resolve on a load-independent executor-drain fixpoint by default, instead of a wall-clock budget.** Model tasks run on a per-test `TaskExecutor`, and a wait resolves when that executor (plus the per-test background + main-registrar observation queues) is quiescent — a non-starvable signal — rather than after a `.deferential`/`.background`-QoS quiet-window that macOS starves under parallel/CI load. This cures the false `settle() timed out: model still has active tasks` failures (empty active-task list) and is dramatically less flaky under `--parallel` (on a contended dev machine the per-100-run distinct-flaky-test population dropped from ~63 to a small clock-bound remnant), while also running the serial suite ~2.6× faster (fixpoint resolution vs. waiting out debounce windows). Unconditional wherever it can run — macOS 15+ / iOS 18+ / Linux-Swift-6 (custom task executors need the Swift 6 runtime); there is no opt-out flag. The wall-clock path survives only as the automatic fallback for test hosts that can't run the drive (pre-macOS-15 / pre-iOS-18 hosts and simulators, older Swift, WASM), selected by availability — not a toggle. The previously-noted clock-driven flake tail is now resolved by two mechanisms: (1) a **global-quiescence fail-gate** — a still-unmet `expect` is failed only when the *whole process* is executor-quiescent, not just when the one test looks idle, so work parked mid-`clock.sleep` (a child activation task, an immediate-clock tick) no longer trips a premature fixpoint while the run is busy (the gate's process-wide counter is a lock-free Swift 6 `Atomic`); and (2) for tests that step a `TestClock` explicitly, an `await settle()` after `withAnchor` and between `advance` calls, which parks the timer (registering its next deadline) before each advance — a TestClock registration-ordering property, fixed test-side rather than fought in the framework. See `Docs/test-determinism-executor-drain.md`.

- **`node.memoize` cache-hit fast path no longer allocates per access.** The `forceNextBox` (`LockIsolated`) and `didModifyCallback` closure are now built only on the first access that sets up tracking, not on every call — they were pure waste on the common cache-hit path, which discarded them.

### Added

- **Memoize regression coverage.** `SwiftModelTests.MemoizeThrashTests` (in the regular CI suite) asserts produce-count stays O(1) after a dependency write and under *deterministic* cooperative-pool starvation (the revalidation queue is blocked on a gate, not left to machine load) — for tracked and untracked access, single and chained memoizes. `SwiftModelBenchmarkTests.MemoizeAccessBenchmarks` adds the on-demand cost benchmark (cached untracked vs tracked access, interleaved-median ratio) plus produce-count under genuine cooperative-pool saturation; like the other benchmark suites it is excluded from CI (run via `swift test --filter SwiftModelBenchmarkTests.MemoizeAccessBenchmarks`).

---

## [1.0.3] — Read-path performance: `withUntrackedModelReads`, striped observer-KP cache, `@inlinable` hot path

### Added

- **`withUntrackedModelReads { }` — public untracked/bulk-read scope.** Reads of `@Model` properties (and memoize/environment/preference values) inside the scope register no observation dependencies anywhere: no `ObservationRegistrar.access`, no `ModelAccess.willAccess` dispatch (view tracking / `ModelTester` / `Observed`), and no access stamping of returned child models. Reads reduce to a lock-protected raw state read — they still route through the context lock, so scanning while other threads write stays memory-safe (unlike the internal `forceDirectAccess` mechanism, which bypasses the lock and stays internal). Intended for O(N) traversals over live models on hot paths — hit-testing, snapping, validation passes — where per-read observation overhead dominates and the caller doesn't want a dependency on every visited property. Writes inside the scope notify normally. Framework-driven dependency collection is immune: `update()` (the engine under `node.memoize` and `Observed`) clears the flag around its `access()` evaluations, so a memoize set up inside an untracked scope still tracks its own dependencies. In the Release read-path benchmark an untracked read costs ~half a tracked read, and the n=120 two-property scan drops ~1.7x; a pre-extracted value snapshot remains far cheaper still for repeated scans (see the new *Performance* documentation article).

- **Read-path + scan benchmarks.** `SwiftModelBenchmarks` (Release executable) gains sections *2b. Read path* (raw vs tracked {no listener, inside `withObservationTracking`} vs untracked), *2c. O(N) scan over live child models* (n=120, the client workload that motivated the untracked API), and *2d. Parallel tracked reads* (8-thread contention probe for process-global serialization points in the read path). `SwiftModelBenchmarkTests.ReadPathBenchmarks` adds ratio-asserting micro-benchmarks (min-of-rounds; asserts untracked beats tracked and raw beats untracked — ratios, not absolute times, for machine stability) including `@testable`-only scenarios (registrar disabled, stamped propagating access).

- **Performance documentation article** (`Documentation.docc/Performance.md`): what a tracked read pays, why the cost is real in Release builds (key-path projection, registrar internals, locks, and cross-module generic dispatch all ship `-O` regardless of the app's build configuration), the ~10–30x `-Onone` inflation to watch for when profiling Debug builds, and when to reach for `withUntrackedModelReads` vs `node.memoize` vs value snapshots.

### Changed

- **The hot read chain is now `@inlinable` — reads specialize and inline into client modules.** Macro-generated accessors compile in the *client's* module, so every tracked read previously crossed the module boundary through unspecialized generic entry points (runtime metadata, witness tables, coroutine shells). The generic `<T>` read subscript, the `Context` state subscript, and `withUntrackedModelReads` are now `@inlinable`, with a minimal `@usableFromInline` cascade (~17 annotations) over the members they touch; only `willAccessDirect` (the registrar machinery) remains an outlined call. Measured (Release, M-series, min of 3): tracked read 774 → 571 ns/op (−26%), untracked read 469 → 283 ns/op (−40%), n=120 scan 192 → 142 µs tracked / 116 → 72 µs untracked. The `@usableFromInline` members remain `internal` — not nameable from client source, gaining linkage visibility only — and a source-distributed package carries no ABI-stability constraint, so the residual cost is encapsulation discipline on the annotated members (compile-time enforced). A new in-module probe (benchmark section *2e*) tracks the remaining gap to the whole-module-optimization ceiling (~508 ns tracked / ~228 ns untracked).

- **Observer-KP resolution no longer serializes every tracked read/write on one process-global lock, and no longer runs a dynamic cast per access.** `Context.willAccessDirect` / `invokeDidModifyDirect` resolved their registrar observer key path through a single `NSLock`-guarded cache keyed by `(contextID, statePath.hashValue)`, whose lookup also performed an `as?` dynamic cast — a `swift_dynamicCast` on the hottest path in the library (the same Linux runtime-cast failure family worked around in 7a59f42, a847c79, and 9d87bd3). A new identity-keyed first level (`_stateObserverKP`) keys by `ObjectIdentifier` of the key-path object (macro-generated accessors pass key-path literals, which the runtime interns per call site) under 1-of-16 striped locks, and resolves hits with `unsafeDowncast` — sound because each entry retains its key-path object (no ABA on address reuse) and the key-path object determines the state type. Misses fall back to the structural `hashValue`-keyed cache, so appended/dynamically-built key paths still canonicalize to the same observer KP; stripes self-clear at capacity (no unbounded growth for generic `@Model` types whose key-path literals can't be interned). Measured (Release, M-series, min of 3): 8-thread concurrent reads of distinct models improve ~35% (≈7.4 → ≈4.8 μs/op under full 8-way contention, see the new *2d. Parallel tracked reads* benchmark); single-threaded reads are unchanged within run-to-run noise (≈0.85–1.0 μs/op before and after — the structural hash of a simple stored-property key path was *not* a measurable share of single-threaded read cost).

## [1.0.2] — Linux `SIGSEGV` workaround + `settle()` budget-cap enforcement

### Fixed

- **Intermittent Linux `SIGSEGV` in `ContainerVisitor` state dispatch.** `ContainerVisitor._dispatchStatePath` ran `modelVisitor as? any _ModelStateVisitor` on every `_ModelState`-level visit, purely to detect the lone `InstallUndoVisitor` conformer. That runtime existential check routes through `swift_conformsToProtocol`, which intermittently null-dereferenced inside `libswiftCore` (`swift_conformsToProtocolMaybeInstantiateSuperclasses`) on the `Linux (serial)` CI job when the conformance cache raced first-time instantiation — the same Linux runtime-cast failure family already worked around in 7a59f42 and a847c79. The cast is replaced with witness-table dispatch on `ModelVisitor`: a `_isModelStateVisitor` discriminator (default `false`) and a `_visitModelStatePath` requirement (default no-op). Dispatch now goes directly off the `V` conformance record `ContainerVisitor` already holds — no `swift_conformsToProtocol`, no `swift_dynamicCast`, and cheaper than the per-property conformance scan it replaces. `InstallUndoVisitor` opts in via `_isModelStateVisitor`; the now-unused internal `_ModelStateVisitor` protocol is removed. Behaviour-identical.

- **In-test `settle()` now enforces its total-budget cap under `.background` starvation.** `settle()` arms its quiet-window deadline with `.deferential` priority, whose `GlobalTickScheduler` callback hops to `DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)` before running — and the settle total-budget cap (`pastBudget`) lives *inside* that callback. On a saturated CI host the `.background` slot may never get scheduled within the budget, so the cap never tripped: `settle()` instead unblocked ~30 s later at the `.modelTesting` trait wall-clock cap, surfacing a misleading `settle() timed out: model still has active tasks.` against an empty active-task list. Debounced `.deferential` entries now arm a *second* scheduler entry at the fixed total-budget deadline with `.responsive` priority, which runs inline on the timer's `.userInitiated` queue and is never starved by `.background`, so the cap always trips on time regardless of pool load. Whichever entry fires first resolves the pending wait; the other becomes a no-op. `.predicate` and cleanup-settle entries were already `.responsive` and are unaffected.

### Internal

- **`GlobalTickScheduler` is now injectable into `TestAccess`** (defaulting to `.shared`, threaded through `ModelTester.init`) and `_drivenTick` gains a `fireDeferential:` flag that can hold expired `.deferential` entries pending while firing `.responsive` ones inline. This lets `SettleBudgetCapStarvationTests` model an infinitely-starved `.background` slot with a per-test manual scheduler — no real GCD timer and no process-global `.background` queue — making the budget-cap regression coverage deterministic and fully parallel-safe. Production and all existing tests keep using `.shared` unchanged; the change is purely additive.

## [1.0.1] — Packaging fix: stable `swift-dependencies` pin

### Fixed

- **`swift-dependencies` is now referenced by a version requirement (`from: "1.13.0"`) instead of `branch: "main"`.** Depending on it by branch made `swift-model` itself an *unstable-version* package, so any downstream project that required `swift-model` by a stable version (e.g. `from: "1.0.0"`) failed to resolve with:

  ```
  'swift-model' is required using a stable-version but 'swift-model'
  depends on an unstable-version package 'swift-dependencies'
  ```

  swift-dependencies 1.13.0 ships the trait-aware manifest the branch pin was waiting for, so the dependency can now point at a tagged release. The `#if swift(>=6.3)` gate around the `traits: ["Foundation", "Clocks"]` override is retained: 1.13.0 still ships the `Package@swift-6.0.swift` shadow manifest (no traits), which SE-0152 selects on toolchains < 6.3, where a `traits:` override would be a hard error. No source or API changes.

---

## [1.0.0] — `@Model` Layout Redesign, Performance Overhaul + API Cleanup

### Changed

- **`@Model` generated code restructured** — tracked `var` properties are now stored in a nested `_State` struct inside the macro expansion rather than as individual backing fields directly on the value type. The model struct itself stores only `_$modelAccess` (8 bytes) and `_$modelSource` (8 bytes).

- **`@Model` no longer synthesises an `Observable` conformance** — the generated `extension MyModel: Observation.Observable { … }` block is removed. Observation tracking for SwiftUI and `TestAccess` is handled internally through typed key paths without requiring `Observable` conformance. Explicit `Observable` conformance on `@Model` types is now redundant.

- **`ContainerVisitor<State>` → `ContainerVisitor<V: ModelVisitor>`** — the generic parameter is now the concrete visitor type rather than the raw state type. `@ModelContainer`-generated `visit(with:)` bodies are updated automatically. Any hand-written `visit(with:)` that spells out `ContainerVisitor<…>` by type-parameter name must be updated; call sites of `visitStatically` / `visitDynamically` are otherwise unchanged.

- **Custom `@Model` inits must use `self.property = value`** — the init-accessor storage layout has no underscore-prefixed backing fields. The old `_property = value` pattern no longer compiles; all properties in user-written initialisers must be assigned through `self.property =`.

- **`debug(_:)` / `debug(_:_:)` moved from `Model` to `ModelNode`** — the closure-form and no-closure-form model-level debug entry points now live on `ModelNode`, matching their doc comments (which always said `node.debug(…)`) and the placement of all other `node.*` methods (`memoize`, `transaction`, `trackUndo`, etc.). Call sites from inside a model body continue to read `node.debug(…)` as before. External callers that were inadvertently relying on the misplaced `Model.debug` need to thread through `.node`: `model.debug(…)` → `model.node.debug(…)`. `withDebug(_:)` (the modifier form on `Model`) is unchanged.

### Added

- **`MutableCollection` of `Model` or `ModelContainer` elements handled automatically** — any `var` property whose type is a `MutableCollection` with `Model & Identifiable & Sendable` elements (e.g. a custom sorted-array type) is now traversed and activated by the framework without requiring an explicit `ModelContainer` conformance on the collection type. The same applies to collections of `ModelContainer & Identifiable` elements.

- **Benchmark target** — new `SwiftModelBenchmarks` executable target (`scripts/benchmark`) covers activation, property reads/writes, hierarchy update, event dispatch, and `reduceHierarchy`. Used to track and validate performance improvements.

- **Reactive single-await test primitives** — `expect { }`, `require(_:)`, and `settle()` now suspend on a single `withCheckedContinuation` and wake reactively on model writes / `node.send(...)` events / `TestProbe` calls. Internally a per-`TestAccess` queue of pending entries (`_pendingExpects`) is iterated under `TestAccess.lock` on every `_noteActivity()` — predicates that pass have their continuations resumed outside the lock. Replaces the prior park-and-loop scheme that retried predicates on a timer. Deadline cancellation is delegated to `GlobalTickScheduler` (below) so the cooperative pool can't starve it. The visible test API is unchanged; the change shows up as significantly faster `await expect` / `await settle` (no fixed polling interval) and as cleaner stack traces (a single suspension instead of nested timer loops).

- **`GlobalTickScheduler`** (internal) — a process-wide GCD-backed deadline scheduler shared by every per-test `TestAccess`. Deadlines for `expect` / `require` / `settle` and the per-test wall-clock cap (`.modelTesting`'s 30 s trait timeout) are registered with the scheduler; it fires from GCD's thread pool, so the cooperative pool can be fully saturated with parallel-test work and the deadline still arrives on time. Hangs in the cooperative pool now surface as a deterministic `[TRAIT timeout]` failure rather than as wedged tests.

  The scheduler uses a **one-shot timer source** armed to the soonest pending deadline (re-armed after each fire). No periodic ticker, no idle CPU cost. The timer itself runs at `.userInitiated` so deadlines surface promptly under load.

  Each scheduled entry carries a **`CallbackPriority`** (`.responsive` or `.deferential`). Responsive callbacks run inline on the timer's `.userInitiated` queue — used for failure-case timeouts and polling, where firing close to the requested deadline is the contract. Deferential callbacks hop to `DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)` before executing — used by **in-test settle's quiet-window check** so suspended cooperative-pool Tasks (which run at `.medium`) get CPU before the check, closing the race where a cascade write lands just after settle's nominal deadline. Cleanup settle uses `.responsive` because `cancelAllRecursively` has already torn down the active tasks and the 200 ms cleanup window absorbs cancel-handler writes naturally; deferring would stall every test's teardown behind the `.background` queue.

  No load-aware multipliers or scaling — adaptation under contention lives entirely in the OS scheduler's QoS prioritisation. Set `SWIFT_MODEL_GTS_TRACE=1` to write per-event diagnostic logs to `/tmp/swift-model-{gts,settle}-trace.log`.

- **`BackgroundCallQueue.onIdle(_:)`** (internal) — a one-shot idle observer. Registering a callback either fires it inline if the queue is currently empty, or arms it to fire the next time the drain runs through and finds the queue empty. Used by `awaitSettled` to compose "no model writes for the quiet window AND `backgroundCall` is fully idle" without a polling loop — important for catching silent memoize recomputes whose `isSame`-true updates skip the `didModify` notification path.

- **`waitUntil(_:)` polling helper** — `Tests/SwiftModelTests/Utilities.swift`. Explicit-polling escape hatch for framework-internal lifecycle tests whose predicates read off-model state (`TestResult` / `LockIsolated` counters mutated from `forEach` callbacks). Not for user tests — `expect` / `require` / `settle` should cover those — but documented in `CLAUDE.md` so the distinction is clear.

- **Per-test wall-clock cap on `@Test(.modelTesting)`** — every `.modelTesting` test now races against a 30 s `GlobalTickScheduler` timer. Hitting it surfaces as `[TRAIT timeout]` and cancels the body task; wait primitives use `withTaskCancellationHandler` to resume parked continuations, so the body unwinds rather than wedging the test runner. Override per-process via the `SWIFT_MODEL_TEST_TIMEOUT` env var (seconds, float).

### Performance

- **`@Model` struct size is now 16 bytes + `let` fields** — tracked `var` properties live in a `_State` struct inside the reference-counted context and no longer contribute to the value-type size. Only `let` properties remain as direct stored fields.

- **Lazy child context creation** — `Context<M>` instances for child models are allocated only on first access. Models with many rarely-reached children pay no upfront cost.

- **Cached key-path → registrar path mapping** — per-property `ObservationRegistrar` key paths are cached after first use, eliminating a per-read heap allocation that dominated property-read cost (~1,910 ns → ~730 ns, ~2.5× faster reads).

- **Shared observation registrar** — all models rooted at the same anchor share a single `RegistrarBox`, reducing per-model allocation and `withObservationTracking` overhead.

- **Reduced lock contention** — `AnyContext.parentsLock` decouples the parents-path lock from the main context lock, reducing contention in read-heavy hierarchies.

- **Cursor-based `ModelContainer` updates** — `ContainerCursor` is now a `struct`; `shouldSkipElement` lets the traversal short-circuit unchanged children, avoiding unnecessary context-lookup work on large stable collections.

- **Lazy dependency capture** — child contexts that have no dependency overrides no longer copy the parent's dependency stack, saving allocations in the common case.

- **Faster `reduceHierarchy` and event dispatch** — internal iteration no longer boxes each step through an existential; ~30–40% faster for wide hierarchies.

- **Lazy main-channel `ObservationRegistrar` allocation** — `RegistrarPair` now allocates its `background` registrar eagerly (every observation-enabled tree uses it) but the `main` registrar lazily on first main-channel use. Trees that never reach the main channel — every model tree on Linux/Android/WASM, plus opt-out trees on Apple — save one `ObservationRegistrar` (and its internal `Extent` heap object) per anchored hierarchy.

- **`_withBatchedUpdates` skips `drainIfOnMain` on non-Apple** — the post-batch `mainCallQueue.drainIfOnMain()` call is now gated on `canImport(Darwin)`. On Linux/Android/WASM no main-thread work is ever enqueued, so the drain was pure overhead (a `Thread.isMainThread` syscall on every batched write).

### Added

- **Swift 6.2 `defaultIsolation: MainActor` support** — `@Model`-annotated types now compile and behave correctly in modules that use Xcode 26's default project setting `defaultIsolation: MainActor`. All conformance extensions (`Model`, `Sendable`, `Identifiable`, `CustomReflectable`, `CustomStringConvertible`) and all framework-facing member declarations (`visit(with:)`, `_State`, `_makeState`, `_modelState`, `_modelStateKeyPath`, `_$modelContext`, `_context`, `_updateContext`) are now generated with explicit `nonisolated`. This is a no-op in modules without a default isolation; it is required so that SwiftModel's non-`@MainActor` internals can access model state without compile errors when the user module injects `@MainActor` as the default. See `Docs/Dependencies.md` for the companion patterns needed on dependency types and plain domain structs in such modules.

- **`SwiftModelMainActorTests` test target** — new conditional target (Swift 6.2+, `#if swift(>=6.2)`) that validates the full `@Model` feature set under `defaultIsolation: MainActor` module isolation: tracked properties, `@ModelDependency`, `node.task`, optional child models, and arrays of child models.

- **`withSetup`** — new modifier that runs a closure just before `onActivate()`. Use it to set `node.environment` or `node.local` keys that `onActivate()` reads (e.g. mode flags that guard which observers are registered). Unlike `withActivation`, which runs *after* `onActivate()`, `withSetup` closures run *before* it, so the model's own activation logic can see the configured values. The closure is called only when the model is anchored; if the model is never anchored, it is never called. Multiple `withSetup` calls are additive and run in declaration order.

- **`ModelOption.disableMainThreadObservation`** (internal) — opt-out for the dual-`ObservationRegistrar` main-thread bridge. On Apple platforms, mutations from background threads queue the main registrar's `willSet`/`didSet` via `mainCallQueue { @MainActor in … }` so SwiftUI/UIKit/AppKit consumers stay safely on main. Setting this option skips the main channel entirely — useful when no `Observable` consumer exists (server-side macOS, CLI tools, KVO-based AppKit apps). Non-Apple platforms (Linux, Android, WASM) behave as if this is always set; see the corresponding "Fixed" entry.

- **`$model.debug(_:)` on `@ObservedModel`** — view-side trigger logging. Call from inside `body` to log which key path on the wrapped model (or any descendant model the view reads) caused SwiftUI to invalidate that particular view. No initialiser changes required, no per-view `init` boilerplate even for models without default values — the body-side API attaches debug for the current render and removing the line auto-disables it on the next render. Mirrors the `debug:` field on `Observed`, `memoize`, `node.debug()`, and `observeModifications()`: takes a `DebugOptions` value honouring `triggers`, `name`, and `printer` (`changes` is ignored — covered by `node.debug(.changes)` on the model itself). The default label combines the wrapped model's type name with the call-site `#fileID:#line` (e.g. `"EditorModel at EditorMidBar.swift:42"`); pass `.init(name: "EditorMidBar")` for an explicit view-side label. All three trigger formats are supported: `.triggers(.name)` (default — minimal noise), `.triggers(.withValue)` (renders old → new via `customDump`), and `.triggers(.withDiff)` (structural −/+ diff, useful when the property is itself a model). The `printer` field accepts any `TextOutputStream & Sendable`, so a small `os_signpost(.event, …)` adapter routes view-invalidation events to Instruments without further wiring; see `Docs/Debugging.md` for the recipe. Works on **both** observation paths: the iOS 16 / macOS 13 `AccessCollector` path (where `ViewAccess` drives invalidation directly) and the iOS 17+ / macOS 14+ `ObservationRegistrar` path (where SwiftUI's `withObservationTracking` drives invalidation and `ViewAccess` is installed solely for debug emission with `suppressObjectWillChange` keeping it from firing a redundant invalidation signal). On the registrar path the install is **sticky-lazy**: until the first `$model.debug(…)` runs in a body, `@ObservedModel.update()` skips installing `ViewAccess` entirely (matching the release-build zero-cost path). The first `attachDebug` flips a sticky flag on the `@StateObject` access and schedules a priming `objectWillChange.send()` so the next render installs the access; from then on every render installs for the `@StateObject`'s lifetime (rebuilding the view with Cmd-R resets it). The body of `$model.debug(…)` is gated on `#if DEBUG` (the function signature is always present), so the call compiles to nothing in release — safe to leave in place when shipping, no `#if DEBUG` wrapping required at the call site. On release the registrar path preserves its zero-cost early-return regardless.

- **`ModelScope(debug:)` initialiser** — `ModelScope` now accepts a `DebugOptions` value at construction, mirroring `$model.debug(_:)` but configured at the scope's init rather than in `body`. Logs which property reads inside the scope's content closure invalidate the scope (rather than the parent view) — a natural way to split a large view's observation surface into smaller, individually-labelled regions for debugging. Default label is `"ModelScope at file:line"` (call-site `#fileID:#line`), overridable via `.init(name:)`. On the iOS 16 / macOS 13 `AccessCollector` path the scope's `ViewAccess` is installed as before; on iOS 17+ / macOS 14+ it's installed *only* when `debug` is non-nil, with `suppressObjectWillChange: true` so `withObservationTracking` continues to drive invalidation and the scope's access exists purely for debug emission. Wrap any sub-`View` in `ModelScope(debug: …) { … }` without restructuring the rest of the view tree.

- **`maxLines:` + `maxDepth:` on `.withValue` / `.value`** — `TriggerFormat.withValue` and `ChangeFormat.value` now take `(maxLines: Int = 20, maxDepth: Int = 4)`. `maxLines` post-truncates the rendered dump and appends `"… (N more line[s])"` when it overflows — protects production logs from huge value dumps (the case that triggered this work: a large `Timeline` value-struct rendered for hundreds of lines per trigger). `maxDepth` is passed through to `customDump` and short-circuits the Mirror walk at the given depth, which is the only knob that actually saves CPU on deeply-nested types. Defaults are symmetric bounded safety nets — pass `Int.max` on either field to opt out of that knob. Both shorthands `static var withValue: Self { .withValue() }` and `static var value: Self { .value() }` preserve backward compatibility at call sites that used the bare case spelling.

- **`captureAccessStack:` on `DebugOptions`** — the dedicated tool for "which read caused this trigger?". Set `captureAccessStack: 15` (or any frame count) and `willAccess` snapshots the body's raw return-address stack at access time, holds it alongside the access registration, and *only when that path actually fires a trigger* symbolicates it (via `backtrace_symbols(3)`) and appends a `\n  read from:\n    …` block to the trigger line. Trigger lines for properties that were read but never invalidated stay quiet — the signal-to-noise ratio for a complex view or expression goes from "one stack per read" to "one stack per actual re-render." Captures are cheap (raw return addresses stored as `[UInt]` bit patterns, no symbolication) and freed when access is unregistered. Free when the field is `nil`; no effect outside `DEBUG`. Honoured by every entry point that has a `willAccess` hook: `$model.debug(_:)` (`@ObservedModel`), `ModelScope(debug:)`, `Observed(debug:)`, `memoize(debug:)`, and `node.debug(_:_:)` (closure form). Ignored on `node.debug(_:)` (no-closure form) and `observeModifications(debug:)`, which observe mutations rather than reads. Composes with any `TriggerFormat` — the stack suffix appends to whatever the trigger line says (`.name` / `.withValue` / `.withDiff`). For memoize and Observed the stack identifies the body or helper that first registered the dependency inside the `produce` / observe closure, useful for nested-closure investigations. **The leading swift-model-internal frames** (`ViewAccess.willAccess`, `Context._modelSeed`, the `@dynamicMember` subscript, etc.) are automatically trimmed from each printed stack so the first visible frame is the user-code line that performed the read; deeper internal frames sandwiched between user frames (e.g. user → `memoize` → user `produce`) are preserved.

- **`AccessObserver` protocol + `FirstAccessObserver` + factories** — new read-side hook on `DebugOptions`. Where the existing `triggers` / `changes` format options report *mutations*, `accessObserver: (any AccessObserver)?` fires on every property *access* through the active debug observation — useful for custom telemetry on access patterns, or LLDB breakpoint trapping at the moment of read. Built-in `FirstAccessObserver` deduplicates by `(modelType, path)` and runs its action up to `limit` times per key. Factory helpers on `AccessObserver where Self == FirstAccessObserver`: `.firstAccess(limit:action:)` (custom action) and `.firstAccessBreakpoint(limit:)` (`raise(SIGTRAP)` so you can `bt` in LLDB and inspect the live reader frames; no-op in release). The hook fires *outside* swift-model's internal locks, so observers may freely perform expensive work (symbol resolution, breakpoint trap). Supported on `$model.debug(_:)`, `ModelScope(debug:)`, `Observed(debug:)`, `memoize(debug:)`, and `node.debug(_:_:)` (closure form). Silently ignored on `node.debug(_:)` (no-closure form) and `observeModifications(debug:)`, which observe mutations rather than reads. **For the most common "show me where this property was read from" investigation, prefer `captureAccessStack:` (above) — it gives you the same information stitched onto the trigger line instead of as a separate emit-on-every-access stream.**

### Fixed

- **`node.task(id:)` / `node.forEach(_, cancelPrevious: true)` — body interleaving across `id`-stream restarts** — when a new `id` value arrived while the previous body was mid-flight, the previous body's underlying `Task` was `.cancel()`-ed but `Task.cancel()` only flips a flag. A body that didn't hit another suspension point (or that had already passed its last one) would run to completion regardless — and could interleave its remaining writes with the new body's prefix through the model context lock. The classic shape is "two `task(id:) { value in … }` bodies both writing the same property with the post-suspension tail of the older one landing AFTER the newer one." Surfaced as `OnboardingTests.shortUsernameShowsInlineError` where the initial `""` body's `availabilityError = nil` write was clobbering the subsequent `"ab"` body's `availabilityError = "Username must be at least 3 characters"`. Fix: in `_forEachImpl`'s `cancelPrevious: true` branch the previous body's `TaskCancellable` is now retained, cancelled, and the outer for-await loop **awaits** `previousInner.underlyingTask?.value` before spawning the next body. The wrapped Task's outer `defer { onDone() }` (in `TaskCancellable`'s convenience initialiser) runs unconditionally — including when the inner `guard !Task.isCancelled` returns early without invoking the user closure — so the await resolves correctly even when cancellation arrives before the body is scheduled to run.

- **Writer-vs-reader lock-order race in `Context._modify` / `Context.stateTransaction` for `Model` / `ModelContainer` properties** — the previous writer sequence was `acquire context.lock → write reference.state → release context.lock → acquire TestAccess.lock → append valueUpdates → update lastState → fire _noteActivity`, with a gap between the two `release/acquire` steps. A reader (a predicate evaluator running on the test thread) holds `TestAccess.lock` from outside its evaluator and then takes `context.lock` to read `reference.state`. If the reader slipped into the writer's gap it could observe the new `reference.state` value while `valueUpdates` was still empty for that path, run its assertion-clearing pass against an empty entry list, and return `.passed` — leaving the entry to survive to the trait's end-of-test exhaustion check. The race was only observable for `@ModelContainer` / `@Model`-typed properties (`isContainerTypeValue` / `isModelTypeValue` short-circuits `isEqualIncludingIds`'s in-flight detection); the closure-typed associated values in `RecordMeeting.Destination.speechRecognizerFailed(discard:)` made the leaf-access backstop missing too. Fix: a new `ModelAccess.acquireWriteLock()` / `releaseWriteLock()` pair (no-op default; `TestAccess` overrides to grab its `NSRecursiveLock`) is called by `Context._modify` and `Context.stateTransaction` **before** acquiring `context.lock`, matching the reader's `access.lock → context.lock` order. The writer now holds `TestAccess.lock` across the entire write + `valueUpdates` append + `_noteActivity` sequence; readers cannot observe an inconsistent intermediate state. `Tests/SwiftModelTests/WriteLockOrderingTests.swift` covers both the lock-ordering contract directly and the end-to-end behaviour.

- **`ContainerCursor.get` force-unwrap when an element is removed concurrently with a child write** — `AnchorVisitor.visitCollection`'s lazy element-path maker (consulted by `rootPathTree()` when `TestAccess` / undo observation queries `rootPaths`) used `coll.first(where: { $0.id == typedID })!` to read the element through the cursor. Under x100 stress in `SearchTests`, the parent's `\.results` could be updated (element dropped from `lastState`) **before** the child's pending `detailLine` write reached `TestAccess.didModify`'s rootPaths walk — the force-unwrap then crashed the test. Fix: the maker signature now also takes a fallback element value (the child context's current live model captured at maker-invocation time). The cursor's `get` returns the fallback when the element has been concurrently removed, so the resulting "from" description is the last live model value — acceptable for a write that semantically targets a freshly-removed element. The change is API-internal (no public surface).

- **Pre-anchor crash on first-property assignment with no default value** — extends the fix from the previous release (which covered child `@Model` properties) to non-Model property types. A `@Model` whose first-declared property had no default value and a non-Model type (plain struct, `Equatable` struct, tuple, etc.) could trap with `Fatal error: UnsafeRawBufferPointer with negative count` in `_pop<RawKeyPathComponent.Header>` when a user-written initialiser assigned the property before the model was anchored — typically surfacing through `swift-dependencies`'s static-`liveValue` initialisation. The pre-anchor `_modify` path in `_ModelSourceBox`'s three non-`Model` write subscripts (disfavoured generic, `T: Equatable`, and the parameter-pack overload) now yields directly into the backing key path instead of taking a local copy first, mirroring the `T: Model` overload. The local-copy pattern is still used when the model is `_isLive` (storage is fully initialised in that mode).

- **`node.memoize { … }` observation isolation across both paths and both branches** — outer observers of a memoized property (a SwiftUI body's `withObservationTracking`, a `ViewAccess` from `$model.debug` / `ModelScope`, a debug collector, a `TestAccess`) now only ever depend on the memoize *sentinel* key path, never on the underlying properties read inside `produce`. Two fixes that together close the leak: (1) `update()`'s `withObservationTracking` branch wraps `access()` in `usingActiveAccess(nil)` so swift-model's outer `ModelAccess` is shielded during the cache-miss / first-access branch; (2) the dirty-recompute branch (which calls `produce()` directly, outside `update()`, to return a fresh value synchronously) now wraps that call in a new `isInsideMemoizeProduce` thread-local that our `Context.willAccessDirect` and `Context.willAccessSyntheticPath` dispatchers read at the very top — when set, they skip both the swift-model `ModelAccess.willAccess` dispatch *and* Apple's `registrar.access(...)`. Because we own those call sites we can suppress the Apple-side `_AccessList` registration entirely (rather than just wrapping in a discarded inner `withObservationTracking`), so the fix also closes the registrar-level leak that previously made a SwiftUI body observing a memoized property re-render whenever any underlying dependency changed, even when the memoized value was `isSame` after recompute. Memoize's own dependency tracking is unaffected: the cache-miss branch uses `update()`'s `observe()` (not flagged); the dirty-recompute branch doesn't re-track because the async `performUpdate` does that later via the same `observe()` (also not flagged).

- **Dep context instance mismatch** — when a `@Model` dependency (dep context) resolves another dependency via `node[Dep.self]`, `nearestDependencyContext` now starts its search from the parent rather than the dep context itself. This ensures the root's explicit `withAnchor { $0[Dep.self] = … }` override wins over the dep model's own `testValue` dep defaults, regardless of dep-loop ordering. Previously, non-deterministic dictionary iteration could cause the dep context to find its own dep instance (D1) while root writes went to a different instance (D2), resulting in `Observed { … }` streams that never fired.

- **Stored-child read-modify-write dep pollution** — when a stored child's `withDependencies` closure performed a read-modify-write on an inherited dep model (e.g. `$0.envProp.state = "childDefault"`), the mutation bypassed `ModelDependencies.subscript` and mutated the shared `Reference` in place, contaminating the parent's `dependencyModels` entry. The parent's dep loop then hit the `_PendingDepKey` cache (same `modelID`) and reused the child's dep context, causing the parent to see the child's overridden value instead of the anchor's explicit two-step override. Fix: dep model entries are snapshotted via `initialDependencyCopy` before `withContextAdded` runs. If the snapshot's `_stateVersion` differs after `withContextAdded`, the clone (correct pre-RMW state, independent `modelID`) is used for the parent's dep context instead.

- **Swift exclusivity violation when replaced property deinits read sibling properties** — in three call paths (`Context._modify`, `_threadLocalStoreOrLatest`, `Reference.clear`), the old property value could be destroyed while `Reference.state` was still exclusively held. If the value's `deinit` (e.g. a stored closure) read any model property on the same model, it triggered a fatal "Simultaneous accesses" exclusivity violation. Fixed by pinning the old value alive until after exclusive access ends (`defer { _fixLifetime(oldValue) }` / `withExtendedLifetime`).

- **Crash at construction and teardown for models with class-reference-containing properties** — `Reference._genesisState` was previously initialised via `_zeroInit()` (all-zero bytes). For property types whose value representation uses a class reference (e.g. `SwiftUI.ScrollPosition`, any struct with a `class` field), all-zero memory is not a valid Swift value; accessing or retaining it crashes. Fixed by initialising `_genesisState` to `state` (the model's actual initial value) in `Reference.init`. `Reference.clear()` now stores genesis into `state` instead of calling `_zeroInit()`, ensuring all reads on a cleared reference return valid values.

- **`@Model` macro: duplicate conformance extensions** — when a user declared `CustomStringConvertible` on their `@Model` type (in the inheritance clause or a separate extension), the macro would still emit an `extension MyType: CustomStringConvertible, CustomDebugStringConvertible { … }` block. The compiler rejected duplicate conformances. Fixed by checking the real compiler's `protocols` parameter (which only lists unsatisfied conformances) instead of inspecting the inheritance clause; `CustomStringConvertible` and `CustomDebugStringConvertible` are now synthesised independently so a user-provided `description` suppresses only the description extension, not `debugDescription`.

- **Observation silently dropped on non-Apple platforms** — `Observed { … }` and similar consumers stopped firing on Linux, Android, and WASM whenever the read happened on the platform's main thread (e.g. inside `onActivate()` called from `withAnchor()` on Android's JNI-invoked main thread). SwiftModel was registering main-thread accesses against a separate `mainObservationRegistrar` whose `willSet`/`didSet` notifications are bridged through `mainCallQueue { @MainActor in … }` — and on Android the `@MainActor` task never executes because Android's UI thread runs Android's `Looper`, not libdispatch's main queue. Non-Apple platforms now route every access through `backgroundObservationRegistrar`, whose notifications fire synchronously on the mutating thread.

- **`willSet`-before-mutation ordering preserved when already on the main thread** — when the dual-registrar split runs synchronously on the main thread, both registrars now fire `willSet` *before* the caller mutates and `didSet` *after*, matching `ObservationRegistrar`'s documented semantics and the pre-dual-registrar behaviour. When the mutation happens off the main thread, the main registrar's `willSet`/`didSet` continue to fire as a post-mutation bundle on `@MainActor` (the strict pre-mutation ordering isn't reachable without blocking the mutating thread). The background registrar always uses strict ordering on the mutating thread.

- **Simultaneous-access trap when a write expression reads any other model property on the RHS** — `Context.subscript[statePath:isSame:accessBox:]._modify` and the three non-`Model` write overloads of `_ModelSourceBox.subscript[write:access:]` previously `yield`ed `&reference.state[keyPath: …]` directly, holding an exclusive dynamic borrow on `Reference.state` (the class-backed `_State` struct) for the entire duration of the user's mutation expression. Any access on the same `Reference.state` during the yield — read or write, regardless of key path — would trip Swift's law of exclusivity with a fatal `"Simultaneous accesses to 0x…, but modification requires exclusive access"` trap. The patterns that hit this in practice include `model.x = model.y + 1`, `model.x = model.x + 1`, `model.x += model.x`, `model.items.append(model.intValue)`, and the optional-chained `model.x?.field = model.x.map { … } ?? .default` shape (which is what surfaced this in the Imagien editor). Fixed by adopting the same local-copy + write-back pattern that `stateTransaction` already uses: the user's mutation expression runs against a local `var`, the borrow on `reference.state` ends before the yield, and a single write-back store re-acquires it briefly after the yield returns. The companion `_read` fix (commit 776f453) covered the read-then-modify direction; this completes the pair. The fully-anchored `<T: Model>` write subscript already used the safe pattern and is unchanged. A known limitation remains for the pre-anchor / live yield in the `<T: Model>` overload, which cannot pre-read because zero-initialised `@Model` fields trap on key-path read — compound writes through a child `@Model` property during a user-written `init()` whose RHS reads `self` can still trip the check; documented inline.

### Removed

All APIs that were deprecated in prior releases have been removed:

- **`node.uniquelyReferenced() -> AsyncStream<Bool>`** — use `node.isUniquelyReferenced` instead. The property participates in the full observation system (`Observed { node.isUniquelyReferenced }`, `node.onChange(of: node.isUniquelyReferenced)`, `node.memoize`, SwiftUI views) and fires only on parent-relationship changes rather than on every modification in the hierarchy.

- **`UsingModel`** — use `ModelScope { … }` instead, capturing models from the enclosing scope.
- **`observeAnyModification()`** — use `observeModifications()` for identical behaviour; the new API adds scope, kind, and predicate filtering.
- **`model.andTester(exhaustivity:withDependencies:)`** — use `model.withAnchor()` inside `@Test(.modelTesting)` instead.
- **`tester.assert { }` / `tester.assert(_:)` / `tester.unwrap(_:)`** — use the global `expect { }` and `require(_:)` functions instead.
- **`TestProbe.install()`** — probes auto-register on creation and on every call.
- **`expect(timeoutNanoseconds:)` / `require(_:timeoutNanoseconds:)`** — timeout is no longer configurable; remove the `timeoutNanoseconds` parameter.
- **`ExpectMode` / `expect(.settling) { }`** — use `settle { }` instead.
- **`_ModelTestingTrait`** typealias — use `ModelTestingTrait` directly.
- **`node.context`** — use `node.local` or `node.environment` depending on the desired propagation.
- **`node.removeContext(_:)`** — use `node.removeLocal(_:)` or `node.removeEnvironment(_:)`.
- **`ContextKeys` / `ContextValues`** — use `LocalKeys` / `LocalStorage` or `EnvironmentKeys` / `EnvironmentStorage`.
- **`node.transaction(_:) rethrows`** — transactions do not roll back on error; compute values outside the transaction, then apply them in a non-throwing `transaction { }` closure.
- **`model.andAnchor(function:andDependencies:)`** — use `model.returningAnchor(withDependencies:)` instead.
- **`model._printChanges(name:to:)`** — use `model.debug()` instead.
- **`model._withPrintChanges(name:to:)`** — use `model.withDebug()` instead.

### Tests

- **Memory layout regression tests** — `MemoryTests` verifies that `_ModelSourceBox` is 8 bytes, `_ModelAccessBox` is 8 bytes, and a zero-field `@Model` struct is 16 bytes total.
- **Init accessor sequencing tests** — `ModelInitAccessorTests` covers init-accessor ordering, zero-init fallbacks, nested models, property-default capture sequencing, and custom inits with child-model collections (regression guard for the `self.property` requirement).
- **Lazy context field tests** — `LazyContextFieldTests` verifies that lazy backing stores (`cancellations`, `memoizeCache`, `contextStorage`, `preferenceStorage`, `observationRegistrar`) remain `nil` until first use.
- **Benchmark harness** — `LazyContextBenchmarks` provides a repeatable in-process benchmark for CI performance regression detection.
- **`WriteLockOrderingTests`** — regression guard for the writer-vs-reader lock-order race. `writerAcquiresAccessWriteLockAroundEachContextWrite()` installs a `RecordingAccess` (a `ModelAccess` subclass that logs each `acquireWriteLock` / `releaseWriteLock` call) and asserts that `Context._modify` calls them in strict pairs around every property write — catches accidental removal of the calls without depending on timing-sensitive race reproduction. `taskWriteOfContainerPropertyIsAssertedByRequire()` is an end-to-end smoke test using a `ModelContainer`-typed property written from an activation task.
- **`TaskIdSerializationTests`** — regression guard for the `task(id:)` body-interleaving race. Spawns rapid `id` changes against a body that performs a long synchronous tail after a suspension point (mimicking the `OnboardingTests.shortUsernameShowsInlineError` failure pattern); fails with `maxConcurrentBodies > 1` if `_forEachImpl` lets the previous body's tail race the next body's prefix.
- **`ReactiveWaitInfrastructureTests`** — covers the `_pendingExpects` state machine: predicate registration, deadline cancellation via `GlobalTickScheduler`, debounce / quiet-window settle, `bg.onIdle` integration, cancellation propagation, and the all-pass / first-failure semantics that `expect { … }` exposes to user code.
- **`CrossModelObservationTests`** — covers observation paths that span model boundaries (parent reading from child, sibling reading via dependency context, environment-storage propagation visibility).
- **Test target split** — the monolithic `SwiftModelTests` is split into three:
  - `SwiftModelTests` (default) — the bulk of behaviour and regression tests; no `InlineSnapshotTesting` dependency.
  - `SwiftModelSnapshotTests` — `OutputSnapshotTests`, `DebugTests`, `PrivatePropertyTests`, `TransitionsTests`, `AssertIssueSnapshot` helpers. All `InlineSnapshotTesting` usage is contained here; lets us scope `swift-snapshot-testing`'s Apple-only types to a single target.
  - `SwiftModelBenchmarkTests` — `CoalescingBenchmarks`, `LazyContextBenchmarks`, `MemoizePerformanceTests`, `TestTags`. Skipped from the default test plan and from `swift test` invocations on CI (`--skip SwiftModelBenchmarkTests`); run on-demand via the existing `swift-model-benchmarks` Xcode test plan or `swift test --filter SwiftModelBenchmarkTests`.

  Effect on `swift test --skip Foo --skip Bar` CI invocations: the three per-file `--skip` flags collapse into a single `--skip SwiftModelBenchmarkTests`. Effect on local test plans: the default `swift-model` Xcode test plan now runs `SwiftModelTests` + `SwiftModelSnapshotTests` (and the example/macro/main-actor targets as before); `SwiftModelBenchmarkTests` is intentionally omitted. The `swift-model-benchmarks` plan now targets `SwiftModelBenchmarkTests` directly (no `selectedTags: [.benchmark]` filter needed).

## [0.15.0] — observeModifications() with Scope, Kind, and Predicate Filtering

### Added
- **`observeModifications(scope:kinds:where:debug:)`** — replaces `observeAnyModification()` with rich filtering options:
  - `scope: ModificationScope` — narrow or widen which hierarchy levels trigger: `.self`, `.children`, `.descendants`, or combinations (default: `[.self, .descendants]`)
  - `kinds: ModificationKind` — filter by change category: `.properties`, `.environment`, `.preferences`, `.parentRelationship`, or `.all` (default). Use `kinds: .properties` to skip environment/preference noise in autosave scenarios
  - `where: (@Sendable (Any) -> Bool)?` — model-type predicate; return `true` to include the emission. Useful for filtering to a specific protocol or type in large hierarchies
  - `debug: DebugOptions?` — pass `.triggers()` to print a line for each emission with model name, kind, and depth. Only active in DEBUG builds
- **`node.excludeFromModifications(_ paths:)`** — declares specific properties of a model as "transient": their changes will not trigger any `observeModifications()` registered on this model or its ancestors. Useful for caches, scroll positions, and other volatile state. Declared in `onActivate()`, mirrors the `trackUndo(_ paths:)` API. Only affects `observeModifications()` — other observation mechanisms are unaffected
- **`ModificationKind`** — new `OptionSet` type categorising modification kinds (`.properties`, `.environment`, `.preferences`, `.parentRelationship`, `.all`)
- **`ModificationScope`** — new `OptionSet` type describing hierarchy depth (`.self`, `.children`, `.descendants`)

### Deprecated
- **`observeAnyModification()`** — superseded by `observeModifications()`. Replace `observeAnyModification()` with `observeModifications()` for identical behaviour; use the new parameters to filter as needed

---

## [0.14.1] — ModelScope + iOS 16 Bug Fixes

### Added
- **`ModelScope`** — new SwiftUI view that scopes observation to its content, preventing unnecessary parent re-renders. Wrapping reactive content in `ModelScope` confines observation to that sub-tree: only `ModelScope` re-renders when its accessed properties change, leaving the parent unaffected. Also fixes an iOS 16 issue where model properties accessed inside lazy `@ViewBuilder` closures (`.sheet`, `.popover`, `GeometryReader`, `NavigationStack` destinations) were not observed. On iOS 17 and later, `ModelScope` is a transparent pass-through — the platform already scopes observation per view boundary.

### Deprecated
- **`UsingModel`** — superseded by `ModelScope`. Replace `UsingModel(model) { model in … }` with `ModelScope { … }`, capturing the model from the enclosing scope. `ModelScope` naturally handles multiple models accessed in the same closure.

### Fixed
- **`@MainActor` missing from `mainCallQueueDrainLoop`** — on iOS 16, `objectWillChange.send()` could fire off the main thread after the drain loop's first `Task.yield()` suspension, breaking the `AccessCollector` observation path. Adding `@MainActor` ensures every batch — including post-yield batches — runs on the main thread.
- **`containerIsSame` for `@ModelContainer` enums** — when an enum conforming to `Equatable` (via `@ModelContainer` synthesis or explicitly) was written with the same value, the write was incorrectly treated as a mutation, triggering spurious view re-renders and `onChange` callbacks. The equality check is now performed before recording a modification.

---

## [0.14.0] — Exhaustivity Improvements + Convenience Helpers

### Added
- **`node.task(id:)`** — cancel-in-flight convenience. `node.task(id: query) { q in … }` restarts the async task whenever the expression changes and cancels the in-flight task first. Equivalent to `node.task { node.forEach(Observed { query }) { q in … } }` but more concise.
- **`node.onChange(of:)`** — lightweight helper to react to a value change without a full `forEach` loop.
- **Transitions exhaustivity** — new `Exhaustivity.transitions` category. When a `@Model` enum switches cases, the test framework tracks the transition and fails if it goes unasserted, just like state and event exhaustivity. Transitions within a transaction are grouped as a single update.
- **Private property exclusion from exhaustivity** — `private var` and `fileprivate var` properties are automatically excluded from exhaustivity tracking. Tests no longer fail for internal state that the test cannot observe. `private(set) var` (public getter) is still tracked normally.
- **`@ModelDependency(\.continuousClock) var clock: any Clock<Duration>`** — alternative property-wrapper form to `node.clock` for consistency with the general `@ModelDependency` pattern.
- Additional compile-time diagnostics in the `@Model` macro for common misuse patterns.

### Changed
- **`DebugOptions` API** — improved syntax for `model.withDebug(…)` / `model.debug(…)` options. Options are now more composable and self-documenting.
- **State not exhausted error messages** — failure messages now show a structured diff of the unexpected state changes instead of a raw description.
- **Exhaustivity type** — simplified option-set API; redundant overloads removed.
- **`swift-async-algorithms` removed from library target** — internal `eraseToStream()` and `removeDuplicates()` helpers replace the package dependency. `swift-async-algorithms` is kept as a test-only dependency (`AsyncChannel` is used in a small number of test files).
- **Pre-Swift 6.1 guard on `@Test(.modelTesting)`** — using `.modelTesting` on Swift 6.0 now calls `reportIssue` with a clear migration hint to `withModelTesting { }` instead of failing silently.

### Fixed
- **Deadlock in test infrastructure** — `invokeDidModify` now returns a `(() -> Void)?` callback that callers invoke *after* releasing the lock. Combined with per-test `BackgroundCallQueue` isolation (via `_BackgroundCallLocals` task-local), this eliminates a class of deadlock that could occur when multiple tests ran concurrently.
- **Lock-ordering inversion in `Context.rootPaths`** — fixed a lock-ordering inversion that could deadlock when accessing root paths concurrently with context teardown.
- **Exhaustivity tracking races** — each `@Test(.modelTesting)` test now receives an isolated `BackgroundCallQueue`, preventing exhaustivity assertions from leaking between concurrent tests.

### Performance
- `@inlinable` annotations added to hot paths in the observation and context subsystems.
- Lazy allocation of cancellations, observation registrars, and context dictionaries — reduces memory footprint for models that don't use every feature.

### Documentation
- README restructured into a ~200-line landing page. Full reference content lives in `Docs/` subdocuments: `Models.md`, `Lifecycle.md`, `Events.md`, `Dependencies.md`, `Navigation.md`, `HierarchyAndPreferences.md`, `Testing.md`, `Undo.md`, `Debugging.md`, `TransitionsDesign.md`.

---

## [0.13.1] — Concurrency Fixes, Cross-Platform CI & README Badges

### Fixed
- **Memoize stale cache after concurrent reset** — fixed a race in the `withObservationTracking` (async) path where `performUpdate`'s `onUpdate` could recreate a cache entry removed by `resetMemoization`, leaving a stale value with no active subscription. Also preserved the `isDirty` flag when a concurrent mutation occurs between `observe()` and `onUpdate()`.
- **Memoize dirty flag lost in sync path** — fixed `wrappedOnUpdate` unconditionally clearing `isDirty` to `false`, losing dirty flags set by concurrent mutations between `produce()` and the cache write. Also added a guard against re-creating entries removed by `resetMemoization`.
- **ARC race in `onRemoval`** — deferred release of memoize cache entries to outside the context lock, preventing a crash when GCD-dispatched `performUpdate` closures raced with `_memoizeCache.removeAll()` during teardown.
- **TestAccess race** — fixed a race condition in `TestAccess`.

### Changed
- **CI Linux tests run serially** (`--no-parallel`) to avoid cooperative thread pool saturation on 2-vCPU runners.
- **BackgroundCallQueue** reverted to GCD-based drain on Apple/Linux for more predictable scheduling.
- Several flaky tests restricted to `AccessCollector`-only path where `withObservationTracking` async timing caused spurious failures.

### Added
- **WASM support** — library compiles for `wasm32-unknown-wasip1` (compile-check in CI).
- **Android support** — test target compiles for `aarch64-unknown-linux-android28` (build-check in CI).
- **CI badges** — per-platform badges in README: macOS and Linux (tests), Android and WASM (build).

---

## [0.13.0] — Context Storage API Split + Named Tasks + Settle API

### Added
- **Named tasks** — `node.task` and `node.forEach` now accept an optional `_ name: String? = nil` parameter. When provided, the name is passed to Swift's `Task(name:)` and surfaced in test exhaustion failure messages so it's immediately clear which task was still running. When omitted, a name is synthesised automatically from the call site: `"onActivate() @ Counter.swift:42"`.
- **`forEach` unhandled error reporting** — when `catch:` is omitted from `node.forEach` and the upstream sequence throws (or the operation throws with `abortIfOperationThrows: true`), `reportIssue` is called at the call site. In test mode this fails the test; in debug production builds it triggers an `assertionFailure`. Per-element errors with `abortIfOperationThrows: false` (the default) remain intentionally swallowed as before.
- **`node.local`** — new accessor for node-private storage. Reads and writes are isolated to the node; descendants do not inherit the value.
- **`node.environment`** — new accessor for top-down propagating storage. Writes are visible to all descendants (equivalent to the old `.environment` propagation).
- **`LocalKeys` / `LocalStorage`** — namespace and descriptor type for declaring node-private storage keys.
- **`EnvironmentKeys` / `EnvironmentStorage`** — namespace and descriptor type for declaring top-down propagating storage keys.
- **`node.removeLocal(_:)`** — removes a local storage value back to default.
- **`node.removeEnvironment(_:)`** — removes a local override, causing the node to inherit from its nearest ancestor again.
- **`Exhaustivity.environment`** — new exhaustivity category for `node.environment` writes (separate from `.local`).
- **`settle()` function** — standalone function that waits for activation tasks to enter their body, runs an idle cycle until no state changes occur, then resets the exhaustivity baseline. Four overloads: builder, no-predicate, `Bool` autoclosure, and `TestPredicate`.
- **`settle(resetting:)` parameter** — controls which exhaustivity categories are reset after settling. Accepts an `Exhaustivity` value (default `.full`). Use `resetting: .full.removing(.events)` to keep tracking events across the settle boundary. Categories: `.state`, `.events`, `.tasks`, `.probes`, `.local`, `.environment`, `.preference`.
- **Rich settle timeout diagnostics** — when settle times out, the failure message now includes details about which activation tasks are still running, pending state changes, and the current model state.

### Deprecated
- **`node.context`** — use `node.local` or `node.environment` depending on the desired propagation.
- **`node.removeContext(_:)`** — use `node.removeLocal(_:)` or `node.removeEnvironment(_:)`.
- **`ContextKeys` / `ContextValues`** — use `LocalKeys` / `LocalStorage` or `EnvironmentKeys` / `EnvironmentStorage`.
- **`Exhaustivity.context`** — use `[.local, .environment]` to cover both, or target one specifically.
- **`timeoutNanoseconds` on `expect`/`require`/`tester.assert`** — timeout is no longer needed. The framework uses activity-relative idle detection with a fixed 5-second hard cap instead of user-configurable timeouts.

### Changed
- Debug trigger output now shows `ModelType.local.keyName` / `ModelType.environment.keyName` instead of the generic `ModelType.context.keyName`.
- Exhaustion failure messages now say "Local not exhausted" / "Environment not exhausted" instead of "Context not exhausted".
- Settling now uses `modificationCount`-based idle detection instead of configurable timeouts. A fixed 5-second hard cap replaces the previous 30-second cap.

---

## [0.12.0] — Testing Overhaul & Swift 6.1+

### Added
- **`@Test(.modelTesting)` trait** — new primary testing API. Annotate a `@Test` or `@Suite` with `.modelTesting`; call `model.withAnchor()` inside the body and the model automatically connects to the test scope. Use the global `expect { }` and `require(_:)` functions for assertions. Requires Swift 6.1+ (`TestScoping`).
- **`withModelTesting { }` scope function** — inline testing scope for tests that must observe post-deallocation side-effects (teardown logs, `onCancel` callbacks). Models anchored inside the closure are torn down when the closure returns, before the test function exits.
- **`withExhaustivity(_:)` / `withExhaustivity(_:_:)` functions** — temporarily adjust exhaustivity for a portion of a test body without affecting the enclosing scope.
- **`TestProbe` auto-registration** — probes now auto-register with the active `.modelTesting` scope at creation time and on every call; no explicit setup required.
- **`@ModelContainer` Hashable and Identifiable synthesis** — declare `Hashable` on a `@ModelContainer` enum and the macro synthesises `==` and `hash(into:)`; `Identifiable` is also synthesised with a stable `id`. `@Model` associated values compare and hash by identity; `Equatable`/`Hashable` value types use their natural equality. Manual implementations suppress synthesis.
- **GitHub Actions CI** — macOS (`macos-15`, latest Xcode) and Linux (Swift 6.1, 6.2, 6.3).
- `Documentation.docc` landing page and `.spi.yml` for Swift Package Index hosted docs.

### Changed
- **Minimum Swift version is now 6.1** — required for `TestScoping`, which makes the `.modelTesting` trait fully functional.
- **Linux is now a supported platform** — removed Apple-only `platforms:` restriction from `Package.swift`.
- `ModelID.description` now includes the raw integer value for easier debugging.
- `Model` is now `@unchecked Sendable` — the locking discipline is internally maintained.
- `node.transaction { }` no longer `rethrows` — transactions have no rollback; compute new values first, then apply them inside the transaction.
- Comprehensive `///` doc comments across all public API.

### Deprecated
- `model.andTester(options:withDependencies:)` — use `model.withAnchor()` inside `@Test(.modelTesting)` instead.
- `tester.assert { }` / `tester.unwrap { }` — use the global `expect { }` / `require(_:)` functions instead.
- `TestProbe.install()` — probes auto-register on creation and on every call; explicit `install()` is no longer needed.

---

## [0.11.0] — Debug API Overhaul

### Added
- **New debug API** — `model.withDebug([DebugOptions])` and `model.debug([DebugOptions])` replace `_printChanges` / `_withPrintChanges` with a composable, configurable system:
  - `.triggers()` — print which property triggered each update. Formats: `.name` (default), `.withValue` (old → new), `.withDiff` (structured diff of the triggering property).
  - `.changes()` — print the state diff after each update. Styles: `.compact` (default, only changed lines and structural ancestors), `.collapsed` (unchanged siblings shown as `… (N unchanged)`), `.full` (complete before/after context).
  - `.name("label")` — prefix all output with a custom label.
  - `.printer(stream)` — redirect output to a custom `TextOutputStream`.
  - `.shallow` — observe only the root model's own properties, not descendants.
  - Debug options accepted by `node.memoize(for:debug:)` and `Observed(debug:)` to trace individual computed values and observation-driven side effects.
  - Context and preference write triggers are now shown in debug output.

### Fixed
- Fixed races in `memoize` that caused it to stop observing updates after the first invalidation.
- Fixed two data races in context storage access.
- Fixed a regression in dependency forwarding inside `node.task` closures.
- Fixed an infinite loop in `TestAccess`.
- Fixed a deadlock in debug print diff.
- Improved observation and `memoize` to use model identity comparison, avoiding spurious re-evaluations.

---

## [0.10.1] — Bug Fix

### Fixed
- Fixed a deadlock in `TestAccess` when accessing property names concurrently.

## [0.10.0] — Context and Preferences

### Added
- **`node.context`** — top-down context propagation across the model hierarchy. Declare keys by extending `ContextKeys` with `ContextStorage` descriptors. Supports `.environment` propagation for values that automatically flow to all descendants.
- **`node.preference`** — bottom-up preference aggregation. Declare keys by extending `PreferenceKeys` with `PreferenceStorage` descriptors and a `reduce` closure.
- **`node.touch(\.property)`** — force observation notifications for a property, bypassing the `Equatable` deduplication check. Useful when external backing state mutates in-place.
- `Exhaustivity` now tracks `.context` and `.preference` writes in addition to state, events, tasks, and probes.

### Fixed
- Fixed recursive and deadlock bugs in preference storage.
- Fixed deadlock in `TestAccess` property name helper.

---

## [0.9.0] — Undo/Redo and `node` Visibility

### Added
- **Built-in undo/redo** via `node.trackUndo()`. Call from `onActivate()` to register which properties participate. Supports `ModelUndoStack` (programmatic), `UndoManagerBackend` (system Cmd+Z), selective tracking by key path, and exclusion.
- `Duration`-based timeout overloads for `tester.assert()` and `tester.unwrap()`.
- `showSkippedAssertions` on `ModelTester` — print unasserted effects without failing, for debugging.

### Changed
- `node` is now the primary way to access the model runtime; the underlying `_$modelContext` property is hidden.
- `@ModelIgnored` and `@ModelTracked` renamed to `@_ModelIgnored` and `@_ModelTracked` to make their internal nature explicit.

### Fixed
- Fixed a data race in the undo system.
- Improved `TestAccess` assertion wait behaviour for stressed test environments.
- Fixed forwarding of model dependencies inside `node.task` closures.

---

## [0.8.0] — Swift Testing, Samples, and Observation Polish

### Added
- All tests migrated from XCTest to Swift Testing (`import Testing`).
- `node` property made `public` with full doc comments.
- All example apps updated to compile on macOS and bundled in a workspace with a test plan.
- `node.transaction { }` — atomic multi-property mutations; observation callbacks deferred until completion.
- Extensive `memoize` documentation and test coverage.

### Changed
- `ObservedModel` now uses `withObservationTracking` on iOS 17+ / macOS 14+ when available.
- `Observed` coalesces updates by default.
- Removed deprecated `DebugHook.record` hooks.

### Fixed
- Fixed nested `memoize` crash.
- Fixed dirty-tracking race in memoized computed properties.
- Numerous flaky test fixes.

---

## [0.7.0] — Dictionary Support and Cleanup

### Added
- `Dictionary` conforms to `ModelContainer` when its values conform to `ModelContainer`.

### Removed
- Removed deprecated `change` and `update` key-path-based stream APIs (superseded by `Observed`).

### Changed
- `memoize` extended to accept any user-provided key string; `resetMemoization` added.

---

## [0.6.0] — `Observed` Stream

### Added
- **`Observed { ... }` stream** — observe any model properties accessed in a closure. Emits when any accessed property changes. Replaces the old `change`/`update` key-path APIs. Use with `node.forEach(Observed { count }) { ... }` or directly as an `AsyncSequence`.
- `Observed` deduplicates consecutive equal values for `Equatable` types.

### Deprecated
- Key-path-based `change` and `update` stream methods (removed in 0.7.0).

---

## [0.5.0] — Hierarchy Traversal and Memoization

### Added
- **`node.reduceHierarchy` / `node.mapHierarchy`** — traverse and query any portion of the model hierarchy by `ModelRelation` (`.self`, `.parent`, `.ancestors`, `.children`, `.descendants`, `.dependencies`).
- **`node.memoize(for:) { }` — cached computed properties that auto-invalidate when observed dependencies change.
- `node.forEach` with `cancelPrevious: true` — cancel the previous element's async work when a new value arrives.
- Equatable deduplication for model property writes — writing the same value is a no-op; no observers are notified.

## [0.4.0] — Swift 6 Strict Concurrency

### Changed
- **Swift 6 language mode** (`swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]`) — all code is strict-concurrency-safe.
- Replaced `XCTFail` with `reportIssue` from `IssueReporting` for runtime diagnostics in tests.
- `Cancellable` protocol now conforms to `Sendable`.

### Added
- `node` accessible from model extensions in separate files (changed to `internal`).
- `node.mapHierarchy` / `node.reduceHierarchy` — parent/ancestor access helpers.
- Events from types conforming to a protocol (not just concrete `Model` types) via `node.event(fromType:)`.

---

## [0.3.0] — Model Sharing and `@ModelDependency`

### Added
- **Model sharing** — the same model instance can live at multiple points in the hierarchy simultaneously. Events from shared models are coalesced; `onActivate` runs once; the model is deactivated when the last reference is removed.
- **`@Model` types as dependencies** — conform a model to `DependencyKey` to make it a shared dependency, automatically inserted into the hierarchy on first access.
- **`@ModelDependency` macro** — convenient shorthand for accessing model dependencies as computed properties.
- `ModelDependencies` wrapper — `@dynamicMemberLookup` over `DependencyValues`, used in `andTester { }` and `withAnchor { }` dependency override closures.
- Example apps: `SharedState`, `SignUpFlow`, `SignUpFlowUsingDependency`.

---

## [0.2.0] — Data Race Fixes

### Fixed
- Fixed data races in `Context`.
- Fixed `InternalCancellables` to hold weak reference to `Cancellations` (prevents retain cycles).
- Fixed regression with nested transactions.

---

## [0.1.0] — Initial Release

- `@Model` macro — synthesizes observable storage, `Model`/`Identifiable`/`Sendable`/`CustomStringConvertible` conformances, and the `node` property.
- `@ModelContainer` macro — synthesizes `visit(_:)` for hierarchy traversal.
- `ModelAnchor` / `withAnchor()` / `andAnchor()` — root lifetime management.
- `ModelNode` — access to `task`, `forEach`, `send`, `event`, `onActivate`, `cancelAll`, `cancellationContext`, `onCancel`, dependency access, and more.
- `ModelTester` / `TestProbe` / `Exhaustivity` — exhaustive testing of state, events, tasks, and callbacks.
- `@ObservedModel` — SwiftUI property wrapper providing bindings and fine-grained observation.
- `swift-dependencies` integration for dependency injection and overrides.
- `_printChanges()` / `_withPrintChanges()` — debug-build state change printing.
- Example apps: `CounterFact`, `Standups`, `TodoList`.
