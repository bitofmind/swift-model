#  Standups

The sample app is a straight refactoring of a [sample app](https://github.com/pointfreeco/episode-code-samples/tree/1dcb756f63536461af71f8ca8b2682dcd12e3cb4/0150-derived-behavior-pt5) that [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co) wrote in both plain vanilla SwiftUI and in [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) (TCA), that was used as a reference when the initial design of One State took place in the fall of 2021. Note that especially TCA has evolved a bit since that sample was written.
