#Standups

This sample app is a refactoring of Apple's [Scrumdinger](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger) sample app for Swift Model, that [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co) wrote in both [plain vanilla SwiftUI](https://github.com/pointfreeco/syncups) and in [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/blob/main/Examples/SyncUps) (TCA).
