/// A type that models the state and logic that drives SwiftUI views.
///
/// Conform to `Model` via the `@Model` macro, which generates the required storage and
/// observation tracking:
///
/// ```swift
/// @Model struct CounterModel {
///     var count = 0
///
///     func incrementTapped() { count += 1 }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// > Important: Models must be `struct` types. Classes are not supported.
///
/// ## Using a model in SwiftUI
///
/// On iOS 17+ / macOS 14+, models automatically conform to `Observable` and can be used
/// directly with `@State` or passed as properties. On earlier platforms, use `@ObservedModel`:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct CounterView: View {
///     @ObservedModel var model: CounterModel
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Button("\(model.count)") { model.incrementTapped() }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Anchoring
///
/// The root model must be anchored before use. Anchoring activates the model hierarchy and
/// calls each model's `onActivate()`:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct MyApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         WindowGroup {
///             ContentView(model: AppModel().withAnchor())
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Identity
///
/// Every model is `Identifiable`. By default, `@Model` synthesises an `id` property backed by
/// an auto-generated `ModelID` — a compact integer that is stable for the lifetime of the model
/// in the hierarchy.
///
/// If you declare your own `id` property, the macro uses it instead:
///
/// ```swift
/// @Model struct TodoModel {
///     let id: Int          // your own stable identity
///     var title: String
/// }
/// ```
///
/// > Note: Even when you provide your own `id`, SwiftModel still tracks the model instance
/// > internally using a `ModelID`. Your `id` is used for `Identifiable` conformance
/// > (e.g. `ForEach`, navigation stack paths) but is independent of the internal tracking.
public protocol Model: ModelContainer, Identifiable, Sendable {
    /// The type of events that this model can send
    associatedtype Event = ()

    /// Called once when the model is activated (becomes part of an anchored hierarchy).
    ///
    /// Use `onActivate()` to start async tasks, subscribe to events, and set up reactive
    /// observations. All work started here is automatically cancelled when the model is removed
    /// from the hierarchy.
    ///
    /// Parents are always activated before their children, and children are deactivated before
    /// their parents — so a parent can safely observe child events and tear them down in order.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// func onActivate() {
    ///     node.forEach(node.continuousClock.timer(interval: .seconds(1))) { _ in
    ///         elapsed += 1
    ///     }
    /// }
